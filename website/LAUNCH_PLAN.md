Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built VideoConvert because I was frustrated with cloud-based video
converters. Why should I upload my videos to someone else's server just
to change the aspect ratio?

With VideoConvert, everything happens locally on your machine using FFmpeg.
Your videos stay private, and conversion is instant.
