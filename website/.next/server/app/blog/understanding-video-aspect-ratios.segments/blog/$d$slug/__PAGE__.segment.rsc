# Understanding Video Aspect Ratios: A Complete Guide

Aspect ratio is one of the most important concepts in video production. It determines how your video appears on different screens and platforms.

## What is Aspect Ratio?

Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between a video's width and height. It's expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (e.g., 16:9).

## Common Aspect Ratios

### 16:9 (Widescreen)
The standard for:
- YouTube
- Television
- Desktop monitors
- Most digital cameras

### 9:16 (Vertical)
The standard for:
- TikTok
- Instagram Stories/Reels
- YouTube Shorts
- Snapchat

### 1:1 (Square)
Popular for:
- Instagram feed posts
- Facebook posts
- Twitter videos

### 4:5 (Portrait)
Used for:
- Instagram feed (optimized)
- Facebook feed

## Choosing the Right Aspect Ratio

Consider these factors:

1. **Platform requirements**: Each platform has optimal ratios
2. **Content type**: Landscapes work in 16:9, people in 9:16
3. **Viewing device**: Mobile viewers prefer vertical content

## Transform Modes Explained

When converting between aspect ratios, you have three options:

### Fit (Letterbox)
Preserves the entire video by adding bars. Best when you can't lose any content.

### Fill (Crop)
Crops the video to fill the new frame. Best for dynamic content with centered subjects.

### Stretch
Distorts the video to fit. Generally not recommended.

## Conclusion

Understanding aspect ratios helps you create content that looks great everywhere. Use VideoConvert to easily adapt your videos for any platform.
