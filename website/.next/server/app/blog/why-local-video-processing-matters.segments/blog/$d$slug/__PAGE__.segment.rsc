# Why Local Video Processing Matters for Privacy

In an era of cloud services, it's easy to forget that uploading files means trusting third parties with your data. Here's why local video processing is the privacy-conscious choice.

## The Problem with Cloud Processing

When you upload a video to a cloud service:

1. **Your data leaves your control** - Files are stored on someone else's servers
2. **Processing happens remotely** - Your content is accessible to the service provider
3. **Terms of service** - Many services claim rights to use your content
4. **Data breaches** - Cloud services are prime targets for hackers
5. **Metadata collection** - Services often track usage patterns

## Benefits of Local Processing

With VideoConvert, your videos never leave your device. Processing happens entirely on your computer using FFmpeg.

### Works Offline
